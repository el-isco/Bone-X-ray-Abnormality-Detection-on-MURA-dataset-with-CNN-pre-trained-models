# Bone-X-ray-Abnormality-Detection-on-MURA-dataset-with-CNN-pre-trained-models
Given a Bone X-ray study, build at least 2 Deep Learning architectures to decide whether the study is normal or abnormal.
The architectures used include a CNN model created from scratch and the pre-trained CNN models ResNet50 and DenseNet169.
